-React and firebase hosting









---THIS IS MY CURRENT ABOUT ME----
I am a self-taught Full-Stack Developer, practicing in JavaScript. 
I use technologies such as React and Angular in combination with mySQL,
PostgreSQL, Express and Node.js to achieve my desired applications. 
I hold my Code to a high standard practicing clean code techniques 
that I have picked up from personal readings from books like “Clean Code” 
by Robert “uncle bob” Martin and online courses such as 
“The Complete Web Developer: Zero To Mastery” and others. 
I chose to specialize in JavaScript because of its massive use in the industry, 
in combination with things like npm, building applications becomes 
smoother and code becomes more maintainable. 
I am looking for an opportunity to earn a living wage while developing my craft 
and becoming a stronger full-stack developer. My dream is to eventually 
develop my own simulation technology.
